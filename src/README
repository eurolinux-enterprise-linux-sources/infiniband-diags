InfiniBand Diagnostic Tools

infiniband-diags is a set of utilities designed to help configure, debug, and
maintain infiniband fabrics.  Many tools and utilities are provided.  Some with
similar functionality.

In addition to the utilities provided a sub-library libibnetdisc is provided to
scan an entire IB fabric and return data structures representing it.  The
interface to this library is _not_ guaranteed to be stable (though we try.)

Dependencies:

	1) libibumad >= 1.3.7
	2) opensm-libs >= 3.3.10
	3) ib_umad kernel module
	4) glib2


Release notes 1.6.7 => 2.0.0

   1) combine libibmad
   2) Removed rdma-ndd
   	2a) Removed need for systemd
   	2b) Removed need for udev
