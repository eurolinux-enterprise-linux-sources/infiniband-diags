libibmad is a convenience library to encode, decode, and dump IB MAD packets.  It
is implemented on top of libibumad.

The main consumer of this library is the infiniband-diags package and it is
therefore provided as part of that package.  The last independent release of
libibmad was version 1.3.13.
